            <h2>About Galoria</h2>
            <p>Galoria was founded by Jefferson Wiseman. A student at a community college</p>
            <p>looking to further his skills in website development while also helping others</p>
            <p>their projects. He had an idea to make a website that would allow artistic students</p>
            <p>to showcase digital art for other people to see. After a successful presentation</p>
            <p>his stakeholders, Jefferson wanted to expand his website.He wanted to make a responsive</p>
            <p>website for digital artists around to showcase their creations. Thats when he made Galoria.</p>
